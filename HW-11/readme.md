1. I created a class Ball and created two methods: change_size and display.
Both of which changed the appearance of the circles, and their locations in
the window.
2. I had to do a little trial and error, commenting out things when my program
didn't work and then figuring out how to put them back in correctly. I had to
review random syntax. As well as for loop syntax.
3. Yes, I had some problems getting the Array to fit in with the rest of my code.
Because Array's are relatively new, I decided to just get the class working
and then add the Array in and make the necessary adjustments. That turned out
to be harder than I thought, I had to make more changes. But otherwise, all of
the class related things went pretty well.
4. I would like to discuss classes and arrays more. I think both of those
just need more time to sink into my brain.
5. I didn't get the chance to assist anyone this week. I got kind of a late
start and had few issues myself. Also, this was a very confusing week for me,
I didn't feel in a good position to really anyone else.
