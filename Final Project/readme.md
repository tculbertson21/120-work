1. I created a simple game where the user plays as Jasmine and attempts to defeat
Maleficent. Jasmine has 5 lives and as she moves across the screen she has to
try to dodge the fireballs Maleficent is throwing her way. If she gets hit,
she loses a life. She gains points for hitting Maleficent with her sword.
2. I preloaded all of the images, made multiple classes(one for Maleficent, one for Jasmine, and one for the Fireballs).
Because I had problems doing the subrectangle method of going through a sprite sheet. I decided to
make each image its' own image, put them in an array, and iterate through the array. I had to photoshop each image,
out of the sprite sheet, delete the background and then load it into my program. Since Jasmine,
has a couple different moves, I had to make an array of array's essentially. I also had to make sure that the
correct array was being iterated through depending on which key was being pressed. I also had to figure out
how to have her go back to standing after she had gone through a certain array. Also, if she had jumped,
I had to make sure that it looked like she came back to the ground and wasn't just hovering the air. Then,
I had to get Maleficent to appear and the fireballs to start working. Getting the fireballs to hit Jasmine,
but also not hit no matter what, or never hit her, was a challenge. Also, getting the fireballs to reappear
and constantly keep firing.
3. I had a lot of problems. Right off the bat my background would not load, I think the path I was giving it was wrong.
so I made a folder called images and put it in the Final Project folder so it would be local and easy to access. And that
seemed to fix that. And then I tried to divide the sprite sheet into subrectangles and go through the sprite sheet that way. But that did not work. A lot of my images were different sizes, which I think was problematic. So, as I said above, I had to photoshop them into their own images and put them in an array and iterate through it, to get the appearance of movement. I didn't really have a ton of problems until I was trying to get each subarray hooked up to a key. There were serious problems with that,
nothing would happen when we pressed the key and we couldn't figure out why. I don't even remember why now, but we fixed it. The next big problem was that she had to go back to standing when she was done moving. And we had to set up this big complicated if branch to make that work. And then I had to create global position variables so that she would actually move across the screen, and I had figure out how to increment those. At first I tried putting it in the key press, but then it only moved on the first image and then stopped. So I had to move it to the if statement. She doesn't go left, I tried to get the orientation thing working that I saw in the cougar example on the website. I did not work, I mean the image flipped, but then it kept moving between two positions. I couldn't figure out why. Never fixed it. So, she doesn't go left, and I just made sure Maleficent stayed on the right, so the user never has to go left. And then, I had a lot of problems getting the fireballs not to hit Jasmine every time they fired, and that was because I had a math error. But yeah, I had to make a lot of phone calls to my dad, so he could look over my code and say "your missing a semicolon" or "your math is wrong here". That was super helpful.
4. I had so much fun doing this project, I'm really proud of how it turned out and I learned so much doing it.
5. I didn't get the chance to assist anyone, this took up all of my time. I was working on this for like 2 hours everyday.
