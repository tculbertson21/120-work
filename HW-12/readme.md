1. I created a class Ball and created multiple methods: edgeCheck, circleCheck and move.
One checked for the edge of the screen, one checked for other circles and one moved the
circles around.
2. I had to do a little trial and error, commenting out things when my program
didn't work and then figuring out how to put them back in correctly. I had to
review random syntax. As well as for loop syntax. I also had to figure out how to
check for other circles, I referred to the examples on the class webpage heavily.
3. Yes, I had some problems getting the circles to bounce off of each other. The edgeCheck
wasn't really a problem. Mostly moving and circleCheck. Moving was weird because
normally I'd just have them appear in random places, they weren't really moving.
Circlecheck was just a lot of trying to understand the distance and radius stuff.
Once that sort of started to sink in, it made more sense and I was able to adjust
things the way I wanted them.
4. Not really. I think I spent enough time soaking it in that things sort of make sense.
Might want to review this section, but this section had some good examples.
5. I didn't get the chance to assist anyone this week.
