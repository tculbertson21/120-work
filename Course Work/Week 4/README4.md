1. I created a self-portrait of myself using Atom. I decided to use the arc() function
to create my hair, rect() for my body, rounding the edges. Ellipses for eyes and head and line()
for arms. I decided not to give myself legs, as I spent a lot of time positioning everything, and decided I
could live without them.
2. I used the classic 'guess and check' method to figure out the right coordinates for my shapes.
In the future, drawing it out on graph paper might be easier. Guess and check took quite longer than
I had anticipated.
3. I had some issues figuring out the coordinates for my shapes, but I figured that out.
I had real problems getting my lines in the right place and resorted to calling my dad.
I did not post my problem on the issue board because it wasn't a technical issue, it was an understanding
issue which I felt would be better solved by having it explained by someone who knows how I learn.
4. I would like to discuss push() and pop() more, as well as the translate() function, I'm not very solid
on any of those and would appreciate more time spent on those topics
5. I didn't. As I said in my last weekly response, I'm pretty new to all of
and have plenty of struggles of my own. I rarely have to time to check or
read the issue board. I don't think I'd be able to help them anyway.
