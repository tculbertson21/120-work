# First Question
1. I learned how to use GitHub Desktop and Atom.
2. I also learned how to move files and edit them.
## Second Question
1. I created files and moved them into other files
  1. I used these test files to explore GitHub and Atom and how they worked
    4. I then used GitHub to upload my test files to GitHub.com
### Third Question
I didn't have a lot issues. Most of this lesson was moving things and just exploring.
I had some issues finding my files, I didn't know where I had saved them.
A simple search solved that easily.
#### Fourth Question
I would like to discuss Markdown some more, I don't really understand why we're using it.
I understand that it's different, I don't really see the point in using different formatting.
##### Fifth Question
None. I'm fairly new to a lot of this stuff.
The only suggestion I could give, would be to go to [https://www.google.com]
