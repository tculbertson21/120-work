# Empty p5 sketch.

["Hello World!" Sketch](https://tculbertson21.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

1. I made the background color red and made sure the text showed up.
2. I took a lot of steps because I had a lot of problems with my live site. So
I tried to create my live site, but I couldn't get my index to show up. So I tried
to put everything in a different folder, see if that would help. That ended up
confusing it. So then I tried to set up a meeting with Stephanie, but are schedules
were really opposite. And then, I managed to see Emily during her new office hours
and she was able to sort things out for me.
3. I had many problems as I described above, and I solved them by reaching out for help
to the TA's. I first looked at the help forum that we created, someone had a
similar problem, but I didn't understand most of the solutions offered. Also,
the person didn't respond to say if any of the solutions had worked, and simply
said he would e-mail the professor.
4. Not really.
5. None.
