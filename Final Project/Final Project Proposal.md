Final Project Proposal
Idea: Simple game, one good character(Princess Jasmine) faces one evil character(Maleficent) with some platforms. Jasmine gets points when she “hits” Maleficent with sword. Loses points/health when hit by fireball. Jasmine should, hopefully, be able to duck and jump as well as attack with sword.
Related work/inspirations:
-	Disney Magic Kingdom (App)
o	Idea of using Maleficent as overall villain
-	Disney Universe(Wii/Xbox/PC Video Game)
o	Character usually has a sword
o	Earns points
-	LEGO video games
o	Having multiple lives
o	Jumping on things like platforms
o	Being able to doge
Impending Problems:
1.	Working with images
a.	I’ve worked with images in HTML/CSS but not with p5, getting comfortable with that.
2.	Animating images
a.	Never done this before. Getting the computer to go through the different images is going to be challenging.
3.	Assigning different sequences of images to different keys
a.	If I want her to jump, maybe that’s the up key. Getting her to do that motion, when that key is pressed. Might be challenging.
4.	Having a character that is not user controlled
a.	Having Maleficent fire fireballs at random could be challenging. Don’t want to overwhelm the user with too many fireballs. Trying to control that but have it still be random.
