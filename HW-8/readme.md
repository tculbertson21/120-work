1. I created a nested for loop to create a full border of color-changing ellipses
constantly changing to a random color.
2. I created variables and incremented them. I created nested for loops, I had
four for loops in total. I rearranged the positioning of my x and y values to
create the border effect.
3. No. Normally I have problems figuring out what x or y should be to get the
ellipses where I want them, but this time around I figured it out really
quickly. I think the whole grid thing, with (0,0) being in the far left
hand corner is actually sinking in.
4. No
5. I didn't get a chance to help anyone with anything this week.
