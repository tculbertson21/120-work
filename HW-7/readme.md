# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
--This is a Comment Block--
line 3 creates the object "ball".
line 4 sets the width of the ball to 40 pixels
line 5 sets ball x location to 10
line 6 sets ball y location to 10
line 7 sets the initial change in x location to 1
line 8 sets the initial change in y location to 1
line 9 sets the initial multiplier for the location change in x to 1
line 10 sets the initial multiplier for the location change in y to 1
line 12 defines setup function
line 13 creates canvas and defines height (400) and width(window) of canvas
line 14 sets background color to white
line 19 sets up draw function
line 21 adds the change in x location times the x multiplier to the current ball position
line 22 adds the change in y location times the y multiplier to the current ball y location
line 25 sets up a conditional branch where the ball is kept within the bounds of the canvas
line 26 reverses direction of Ball
line 28 sets up the same if loop to apply to the y position of the ball
line 29 reverses direction of ball along the y axis
lline 32 fills the ellipse with white\
line 33 create ellipse(circle)
line 36 sets up mousePressed function
line 37 increasing the multiplier so that the ball goes faster in x direction
line 38 increasing the multiplier so that the ball goes faster in y direction
Please describe what the original code is doing.

Why is it working the way it is?
What does each line do?
How can you make the ball change direction?

## How did you alter the sketch?
I used an if loop to change the size of the ellipse as it hit the outer edges of the window
in the x direction. Specifically, I changed it to get bigger as it hits the right side
and smaller as it hits the left side. I also changed the color of the ellipse to purple.
